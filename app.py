st.header("Our Mission and Plan", divider='red')

st.markdown("Welcome to [Climate Resilience Communities'](https://crc.place/) Kids Help Phone Project! Our mission is to leverage cutting-edge technology to understand and address the growing issue of climate anxiety among youth. In our first phase, we are using BERTopic to analyze posts made by youth on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit, focusing on climate change, mental health, and environmental concerns.")
st.markdown('Climate change is not only a global environmental challenge but also a significant source of anxiety among youth. The emotional and psychological toll of climate change is increasingly evident as youth express concerns about their future, the state of the planet, and the lack of meaningful action from those in power. Despite the prevalence of climate anxiety, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding how it manifests in youth. Furthermore, there are limited tools available for early detection and intervention. Without timely support, the mental health issues related to climate anxiety can intensify, potentially affecting youth well-being in profound ways.')
st.markdown('Through our in-depth analysis, we aim to identify key trends, emotional responses, and common concerns expressed by youth online. By uncovering these patterns, we can provide a clearer picture of how climate anxiety is impacting their mental health. Our goal is not just to quantify the rising anxiety surrounding the climate crisis but to provide actionable insights that can inform mental health initiatives, community support programs, and policy decisions.')
st.markdown('We hypothesize that by uncovering common themes, concerns, and expressions related to climate anxiety, and by developing a robust NLP-based or LLM-based model to accurately identify instances of anxiety and interpret the linguistic cues indicative of such feelings, we can create early detection tools and recommend interventions that effectively address climate anxiety. This, in turn, will allow us to better support youth, improving their mental health and well-being in the face of environmental challenges.')
st.markdown('By focusing on the voices of youth, we empower individuals, organizations, and governments to take targeted action in supporting the mental well-being of the next generation. The insights from this project will guide the development of practical support mechanisms and resilience-building strategies.')
st.markdown('The successful execution of this project will provide insights into the manifestation of climate anxiety among youth and help develop a scalable, open-source tool for early detection and intervention. This tool will be equipped with an interactive interface to visualize and implement insights, ensuring accessibility and widespread adoption. Ultimately, our work aims to mitigate the adverse effects of climate anxiety, fostering resilience and well-being in youth as they navigate an uncertain future.')
st.markdown('Join us in this vital conversation and help us build resilient communities equipped to handle the emotional and psychological impacts of climate change.')
